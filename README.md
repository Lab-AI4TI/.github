      <h1>DMD-Neural-Operator</h1>
      <p>
      Solving partial differential equations (PDEs) for various initial and boundary conditions requires significant computational resources. We propose a neural operator $G_\theta: \mathcal{A} \to \mathcal{U}$, mapping functional spaces, which combines dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) and deep learning for efficient modeling of spatiotemporal processes. The method automatically extracts key modes and system dynamics and uses them to construct predictions, reducing computational costs compared to traditional methods (FEM, FDM, FVM). The approach is demonstrated on the heat equation, Laplace's equation, and Burgers' equation, where it achieves high solution reconstruction accuracy.
