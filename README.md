        <h1>PalMon</h1>
        <p>
          A project in which a hardware and software system was developed to determine damage to cargo on a pallet. The project developed:
1. Information architecture systems
2. Web application for viewing damage information
3. Mathematical model for determining cargo damage
4. Hardware for reading data from a pallet

        <h1>PowerGuard</h1>
        <p>
          A project to identify faults in an electrical circuit signal based on mathematical models and methods. The project implements a web application and a mathematical module that localizes and classifies failures based on the Wavelet transform, optimization methods, parallel algorithms and other mathematical methods.

        <h1>Emotional View</h1>
        <p>
          A project to determine the level of client satisfaction based on the dynamics of the client's emotions. The project used machine learning methods and neural networks. The project includes a hardware and software system for reading time series data on the dynamics of emotions and subsequent prediction of the level of satisfaction.
